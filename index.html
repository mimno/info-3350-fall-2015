<p>Instructor: David Mimno (mimno <i>at</i> cornell <i>dot</i> edu).</p><p>TA: Xanda Schofield (xanda <i>at</i> cs <i>dot</i> cornell <i>dot</i> edu).</p>

<p><b>Goals.</b> The course will introduce students to research methods in computer-assisted scholarship. We will learn to represent text documents in computational forms, and to appreciate the effect of choices we make in this process. We will cover a selection of popular tools such as classification, clustering, and topic modeling. Each week we will discuss both the details of computational methods and how each method can be applied in the context of scholarly research.</p>

<p><b>Should I take this class?</b> The course is designed for students with a serious commitment to learning about the past through documents, and an interest in applying computational approaches. Although the course will use programming and data analysis, it is not primarily a programming or data analysis course. <b>All required programming and statistics will be introduced in class.</b> The course is targeted at those with little to no computational background; previous Python experience (such as CS 1110) is useful but not required.</p>

<p><b>Format.</b> The class will be <i>flipped</i>. New material will be introduced in talks and readings from a variety of different online sources. Class time will focus on hands-on experimentation in pairs with instructor assistance and discussion. We will use two different types of readings to introduce material for this course: technical readings and discussion readings.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Technical readings</b> will be introduced on Fridays for the following Monday. These readings are meant to give familiarity and flavor for the technical concept we'll work on the following week: you don't need to memorize all the content, but you should be able to tell us what the concept is, how it's used in text mining, and why it's useful. We will solidify that learning with class exercises.</li>
<li><b>Discussion readings</b> will be introduced on Mondays for that Friday. These will be aimed at demonstrating how people conduct research and experimentation in text mining in the real world. Typically, these will tie in to the technical content preceding the discussion that week. You should aim to be able to discuss how the technical concepts of the week tie in to these projects or essays, what practices you agree with, and what you might have approached differently, as well as if there is any interesting similarity or contrast between readings for the same week.
</ul>
<p>We anticipate that many of these readings will present more material than might be easy to digest the first time around. The goal of this is to introduce the tools and techniques of text mining, not to command to memory how each is implemented and the mathematics behind everything. We encourage you to make a good effort on understanding the material and to bring questions to class about what doesn't make sense.<font color='RebeccaPurple'> We will also have a graduate discussion section to dive further into the current topic with respect to individual fields and specific research issues in student work.</font></p>

<p><b>Office hours.</b>
In addition to being available in class, Prof. Mimno will be available in Gates 205 on Mondays from 2-4 PM or by appointment. Xanda will be available in Gates G21 on Thursdays from 1:30-3:30 PM.</p>

<p><b>Schedule.</b> The schedule can be found <a href="schedule.html">here</a>. This schedule is tentative, and may changes as the semester progresses. Both the 3350 final exam and the 6350 final project will be due on the final exam date announced by the registrar.</p>

<p><b>Evaluation.</b> In-class assignment work will be due on the Friday of that week through CMS. Additional larger assignments will be assigned more rarely throughout the semester to help integrate these skills. <font color='DarkSlateGrey'>There will be a take-home final for students in the undergraduate section.</font> <font color='RebeccaPurple'>For the graduate section there will be an independent research project applying methods learned in class to a document corpus of your choosing, written up in a report of approximately 10 pages.</font></p>

<p><b>Materials.</b> There is no required textbook, although Matt Jockers' <i>Text analysis with R for students of literature</i> is recommended. All other materials will be online.
</p>

<p><b>Programming resources.</b> In order to permit pair programming, we ask the students with laptops please bring them to class. We will be programming in <a href='https://www.python.org/'>Python 2.7</a>. To ensure that everyone has the same tools and packages available, you can install <a href='http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install'>Anaconda</a> and not have to install anything else for the rest of the semester.
</p>

<p><b>Is this a Digital Humanities course?</b> The content of this course falls in the broad category of "DH", but this course is focused on a specific area: computational text analysis. There are many other interesting directions that could also be considered DH. We will talk a lot about the role of computation, and specific computational tools, in scholarship, but we are unlikely to talk a lot about "what is/are Digital Humanities?"</p>
