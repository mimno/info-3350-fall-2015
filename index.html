<h1>TEXT MINING
<i>FOR</i>
HISTORY AND LITERATURE</h1>

<p>INFO 3350 / INFO 6350. Fall 2015. MWF 11:15-12:05. Additional graduate discussion section for 6350 W 12:20-1:10.</p>

<p>Instructor: David Mimno. TA: Xanda Schofield.</p>

<p><b>Goals</b>. The course will introduce students to research methods in computer-assisted scholarship. We will learn to represent text documents in computational forms, and to appreciate the effect of choices we make in this process. We will cover a selection of popular tools such as classification, clustering, and topic modeling. Each week we will discuss both the details of computational methods and how each method can be applied in the context of scholarly research.</p>

<p><b>Should I take this class?</b> The course is designed for students with a serious commitment to learning about the past through documents, and an interest in applying computational approaches. Although the course will use programming and data analysis, it is not primarily a programming or data analysis course. <b>All required programming and statistics will be introduced in class.</b> Previous Python experience (such as CS 1110) is useful but not required.</p>

<p><b>Format</b>. The class will be <i>flipped</i>. New material will be introduced in readings. Class time will focus on hands-on experimentation in pairs with instructor assistance. We will assign a "technical" reading on Fridays, and then work on skills each Monday and Wednesday. On Monday we will assign a "theoretical" reading, which will be a focus for discussion on Friday. The graduate discussion section will focus on further discussion and specific research issues in student work.</p>

<p><b>Evaluation.</b> Homework will be due every two to three weeks, summarizing and reinforcing work done in class. There will be a take-home final for students in the undergraduate section. For the graduate section there will be an independent research project applying methods learned in class to a document corpus of your choosing, written up in a report of approximately 10 pages.</p>

<p><b>Materials.</b> There is no required textbook, although Matt Jockers' <i>Text analysis with R for students of literature</i> is recommended. All other materials will be online.</p>
